# Microsoft Graph Toolkit - Overview and extensibility

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of authentication providers and web components powered by Microsoft Graph. The components simplify connecting to Microsoft Graph and allow developers to focus on their application instead of authentication and the Microsoft Graph API. The components are fully functional right out of the box, but can also be extended to fit most scenarios. The Microsoft Graph Toolkit is available as a library of [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) and also in a React version via a lightweight wrapper.
